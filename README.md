## Semantic Dimensions

[Representation Of Lexical Stylistic Features In Language Models’ Embedding Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18657 ) (Lyu, Q., Apidianaki, M., & Callison-Burch, C.,2023) 
* Build semantic dimension vectors with seed pairs of words on opposite sides of a scale (e.g. bright-radiant for 'figurativeness')

[The Geometry of Culture: Analyzing the Meanings of Class through Word Embeddings](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0003122419877135)  Kozlowski, A. C., Taddy, M., & Evans, J. A. (2019) 
* Same idea for studying how the dimensions themselves (man-woman, rich-poor) change in associations over time 

[Discovering Differences in the Representation of People using Contextualized Semantic Axes](https://aclanthology.org/2022.emnlp-main.228) (Lucy et al., EMNLP 2022)
* This paper works with the difference in word usage from a semantic axes perspective. It uses a tehcnique called z-scoring to transform the anisotropic distribution of tokens from BERT embeddings.

[A Unified Feature Representation for Lexical Connotations](https://aclanthology.org/2021.eacl-main.184) (Allaway & McKeown, EACL 2021)
* Constructs six dimensions of connotation

### Classifiers

[Are “Undocumented Workers” the Same as “Illegal Aliens”? Disentangling Denotation and Connotation in Vector Spaces](https://aclanthology.org/2020.emnlp-main.335) (Webson et al., EMNLP 2020)


### Natural Language Representations

[Interpretable Word Sense Representations via Definition Generation: The Case of Semantic Change Analysis](https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-long.176) (Giulianelli et al., ACL 2023)
* generated defenitions also have a quantitative vector representation.


### Useful Research on Contextual Embeddings

[All Bark and No Bite: Rogue Dimensions in Transformer Language Models Obscure Representational Quality](https://aclanthology.org/2021.emnlp-main.372) (Timkey & van Schijndel, EMNLP 2021)
* The z-scoring and other techniques are evaluated in this paper, which is quite interesting to understand anisotropy.
